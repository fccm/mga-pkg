topic: Question about the license of your games

Hi! :)

I'm interested in packaging your games "Garden of Coloured Lights" and
"Excellent Bifurcation" for Debian and Ubuntu, two of the major Linux
distributions. For "Excellent Bifurcation" I don't have the source
code, but I've read that you want to release it. For "Garden of
Coloured Lights", even though I have the source code, the license
itself is quite fuzzy. Would it be possible that you released a
version under the GPL or some other free software license?

Thanks in advance,
Miry

Hi there!

Thanks for offering to package my games! I appreciate
it.

I'd be more than happy to release EB under the GPL. I
don't have a home internet connection at the moment,
but the next time I'm at the Internet cafe I'll email
you a copy of the source. The only change I'll need to
make is removing the sponsors' banners at the start,
because of course I can't use them in a GPL program.

Since the competition I entered GoCL in is still
going, I'd prefer to wait a bit before releasing a
version without the sponsors' banners (doing so isn't
against the rules but it would be nice not to). I'd be
happy for the game to be packaged under its current
fuzzy licence, but if that's not good enough (and I
know that Linux people are very careful about getting
licences right, so I imagine it probably isn't) I'll
email you GPL source when the competition is over if
that's okay.

Thanks!
Linley

Thanks a lot for your answer, of course I can wait until you consider
it's the best moment to release it. It would certainly be the best to
have it under the GPL or any other free license, otherwise it'll have
to go to non-free and, well, in general it would be much worse.

Good luck in the competition, I'm really looking forward to packaging
it after it's finished. Thanks a lot!!

Greetings,
Miry

Cool. I'll send the Garden source through in a few
weeks.

Here's the source to Excellent Bifurcation. I've
modified it so it no longer needs the banners (which
are in splash.bmp in the gfx directory - splash.bmp
can be deleted). It's just source, so you'll need all
of the other files from the windows binary zip. I
haven't put a licence.txt file in there but I'm sure
you have a copy of the GPL laying around :) GPL
version 2 with the 'or later version' wording would be
best, I think.

The source is not exactly a model of elegance, but
hopefully it won't need any changes to be able to
compile on Linux.

Let me know if you have any problems. And thanks again
for doing this - it's good to see my games on as many
platforms as possible!

Bye,
Linley

Hi! :)

I've made a temporary initial release of the tarball I plan to use for
building the package (
http://users.alioth.debian.org/~baby-guest/tmp/excellent-bifurcation-0.0.20071015.tgz
) . Please have a look at it and tell me if it's correct.

I assume from your previous mail that both the source code and the
game data (graphics and sound) have been made by you and released
under the GPL 2 or later license. Please correct me if it's not like
that or if someone else has the copyright over the sounds or graphics.

Greetings and lots of thanks!!
Miry

Hi there,

Thanks for the archive. I'm at the library at the
moment and I probably won't have a chance to look at
it and get back to you for a few days. You're entirely
welcome to release it as it is, though :)

Yes, I have the copyright to all of the code, sounds
and graphics (and everything else relevant) and I'm
happy for it to be released under the GPL v2 or later.

The competition is supposed to finish judging by the
end of the week, so I'll have the GPL version of
Garden of Coloured Lights to you soon.

Bye!
Linley
